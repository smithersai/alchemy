/**
 * Collect OpenTelemetry from browsers and other clients through your own
 * Worker or Function, and forward it to where your backend's telemetry
 * goes, with the backend's own credentials. Clients post OTLP/HTTP to a
 * path ending in `/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs` or `/v1/metrics`; each body is
 * forwarded unchanged, JSON or protobuf.
 *
 * No ingest token ever reaches the client, the client posts to its own
 * origin, and `route` decides where each batch goes.
 *
 * ### Collecting browser traces
 * **Example:** Relay the app's spans through the backend Worker
 * ```typescript
 * import * as Telemetry from "alchemy/Telemetry";
 *
 * const telemetry = Telemetry.relay({ signals: ["traces"] });
 *
 * // in the Worker's fetch handler
 * if (path.startsWith("/api/telemetry/")) return yield* telemetry;
 * ```
 *
 * **Example:** The browser exports to it
 * ```typescript
 * import * as OtlpTracer from "effect/observability/OtlpTracer";
 *
 * OtlpTracer.layer({
 *   url: `${location.origin}/api/telemetry/v1/traces`,
 *   resource: { serviceName: "bank-web" },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Routing batches
 * **Example:** Send browser traces to their own dataset
 * ```typescript
 * Telemetry.relay({
 *   route: (signal, configured) =>
 *     Effect.succeed(
 *       signal === "traces"
 *         ? configured.map((d) => ({ ...d, headers: { ...d.headers, "x-axiom-dataset": "browser" } }))
 *         : configured,
 *     ),
 * });
 * ```
